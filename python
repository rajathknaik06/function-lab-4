""" Implement a function that counts the number of vowels in a given input string. The vowels, which include both lowercase and uppercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U), are stored in a global variable called VOWELS.



The function should use local variables for counting the vowels and return the count as the output.



Function Signature: count_vowels(input_string)

Input format :
The input consists of a single line containing a string.

Output format :
The output consists of a single line containing an integer representing the number of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) found in the input string in the format:

"Number of vowels in the string: [number of vowels]""""

VOWELS = "aeiouAEIOU"

def count_vowels(input_string):
    vowel_count = 0

    for char in input_string:
        if char in VOWELS:
            vowel_count += 1

    return vowel_count

input_string = input()

vowel_count = count_vowels(input_string)

print(f"Number of vowels in the string: {vowel_count}")
